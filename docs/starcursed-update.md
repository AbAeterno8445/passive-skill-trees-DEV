## **Version 0.2.0 - Starcursed Update**

### **Star Tree:**

- New "Star Tree" sub-tree that you can access from the global tree. Node requires reaching level 30 with any character to allocate.
- Once the Star Tree is unlocked, its first node unlocks **Starcursed Jewels**, which can now start dropping from certain sources.
- Tree features inventory and socket nodes - once allocated, press allocate again while hovering them to open an inventory dedicated to jewels.

### **Starcursed Jewels:**

- Stellar detritus condensed into small gemstones containing residual ancient cosmic energy.
- Technically trinkets but these are collected on collision, and get added to your Star Tree's inventory.
- Jewels roll with different modifiers which mainly affect the difficulty of the run, and feature a **Starmight** counter that is higher the more difficult the rolled mods.
- Starcursed Jewels can be socketed in their respective socket nodes within the Star Tree, and apply their modifiers once socketed.
- Jewels can appear in 4 variants:
  - **Crimson Starcursed Jewels:** these roll modifiers altering the vitality and defense of monsters in the run (e.g. normal/boss mobs have more HP, monsters gain damage reduction, etc.)
  - **Azure Starcursed Jewels:** these roll modifiers altering the might of monsters in the run (e.g. normal/boss mobs have a chance to deal 1/2 heart additional damage, enemies deal extra damage to soul hearts, etc.)
  - **Viridian Starcursed Jewels:** these roll modifiers altering features of the run itself (e.g. extra chance to receive a curse, less chance to find devil/angel rooms, shop items are more expensive, etc.)
  - **Ancient Starcursed Jewels:** a rare variant, these are a set of jewels that apply specific unique effects with rewards associated to completing runs with them equipped, akin to challenges.
- Non-Ancient jewels can also come as a **Mighty** variant, featuring higher rolls and exclusive modifiers, and generally higher starmight.

### **How to obtain Starcursed Jewels:**

- Occasionally found wherever you'd find a random trinket drop.
- Killing champion monsters: 1% chance to find a random jewel.
- Clear boss room: (12 + floor)% chance to find a random jewel.
- Clear challenge room: (20 + floor)% base chance to find a random jewel.
- Clear boss rush: 80% chance to find a random jewel.
- Planetariums: 33% chance to contain one.

### **Starmight:**

- Non-ancient jewels come with a Starmight counter, which is higher the more difficult its featured modifiers.
- Having socketed jewels with starmight grants some implicit bonuses, depending on total starmight:
  - (starmight / 3)% additional XP gain
  - At and above 50 starmight, (2 + starmight / 20)% chance for jewels to drop as **Mighty**.
  - At and above 100 starmight, (starmight / 90)% additional chance to find ancient jewels.

### **Ancient Starcursed Jewels:**

- Set of unique jewels, there's currently 10 different ones to find.
- The modifiers these have are akin to challenges, modifying the run significantly.
- Feature one-time rewards such as "Gain 1 skill point and X respec points when defeating Delirium with this jewel equipped.".
- Once you've found them all, chance to find ancients is reduced by 80% until more are introduced (as you cannot have duplicates of these).
